# codingtests

This repo solutions to coding test problems that I worked on in the last 2-3 months for 
preparing for interviews.

Most of the tests are from LEETCODE site. Just a few of them are from other websites.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. 

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has tons of coding tests listed,
    but it is mainly a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get
    familiar with coding tests.

    Most problems listed can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account will
    allow you gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a paid account is $35.00/mo. I recommend you to save your solutions some
    places else before stopping your subscription service since you will not be able to access
    the content of these problems after you end the subscription.

    I worked on many problems when I had the subscription, but unable to access them to add
    to this repo after I ended the subscription.

- geekstogeeks.com - Another good coding test solution is this website. You can find solutions
    to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty of articles
    on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your skillsets.


... Happy coding!!!
