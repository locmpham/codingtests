# codingtests

This repo solutions to coding test problems that I worked on in the last 2-3 months for 
preparing for interviews.

Most of the tests are from LEETCODE site. Just a few of them are from other websites.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. 

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has tons of coding tests listed,
    but it is mainly a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get
    familiar with coding tests.

    Most problems listed can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account will
    allow you gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a paid account is $35.00/mo. I recommend you to save your solutions some
    places else before stopping your subscription service since you will not be able to access
    the content of these problems after you end the subscription.

    I worked on many problems when I had the subscription, but unable to access them to add
    to this repo after I ended the subscription.

- geekstogeeks.com - Another good coding test solution is this website. You can find solutions
    to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty of articles
    on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your skillsets.

While I hate the coding test practice as I see it as an age discrimination hiring practice in
disguise, I think it could be useful to keep you up to date in terms of algorithms and help to
hone your skillsets in case you have not worked on coding for some period of time. (Let's be
honest about it, everyone, software engineers, needs such practices from time to time).

My discontent with the coding test practice is of the interviewer expectation of a candidate's 
ability to come up with an optimized solution in a short period of time and because of limited
time, the candidate wont have the time to correct mistakes. This, in turn, contributes to more
mistakes to be made. This kind of practice clearly favors those who just gets out of school and 
just went through coding test bootcamp as their memory of the soluttions to these problems is 
still fresh.

While coding test was clearly setup with the expectation that it will help to filter out 
"exceptionally intelligent" candidates. I really doubted the result that they gained. 
The companies may end up with a whole bunch of bookworms and coding monkeys who are either good 
at and can afford to work hard on practicing (and memorizing) coding tests.

In my long years as a software professional, I know in practice that innovations and good ideas 
come from a long process of learning and gaining experience on the subjects we are exploring, not
from pushing people around in hurry. That's why software engineers are often on flexible work
time term.

I hired many people myself in the past, I've never asked people to do coding tests in my interview. 
When I do, only to make sure a candidate can code the programming language that the job required. 

I feel the current coding test practice is unfair to many who do not have the time and resource 
to go through coding test training and worse, violates the laws as I mentioned above. For this
reasons, I have sent letter to POTUS office and many other congressional offices to bring this
issue to lawmakers' attention.

Until the effort gains traction and yield a result in favor to those looking for job.

... Happy coding!!!
