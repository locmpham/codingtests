# codingtests

This repo keeps track of solutions to coding test problems that a Facebook recruiter suggested
me to work on to prepare for Facebook interviews. I hope you will find them useful to you. 

I know coding test is suck and favors people who just gets out of school, but most companies are 
requiring as a measure of skills. Some even religiously believe coding test will help them recruit the 
best candidates. People who were graduating from school prior to 2010 may find coding tests as 
their career killer, as they were trained not to memorize, but to be able to perform research 
on demand and to innovate. I think coding test initially applied by big tech companies for 
recruiting students from University, which I think makes sense as students have spent day-in 
and day-out to do tests or practice coding tests as part of their education. 

Yet, eventually, these companies apply it to every software candidate across the board, which I think 
is super-stupid. Yet, quickly enough, every company in the industry just copy and make it as part
of their hiring process.

So, you may ask, did I get a job from Facebook? 

The answer is NO. Despite of my 2-month effort to practice all these tests on LEETCODE, etc. 
I only managed to remember a few problems. So, my coding test interview is often partial successful.
Yet, they all expect candidates to perform without a hiccup and with an optimized solution.

So, I think they got better luck with someone who just graduates from school.

For me, I am done with coding tests. I cant afford to waste my precious time on these tests. 
I'd rather spend my time working on my own projects.

------  About the coding tests you found on this repo ------------------------

Most of the tests are from LEETCODE site. Just a few of them are from other websites. You
may find my comments in the code useful for helping you to follow the algorithms used for
solving these problems. Most interviews require you to solve problems with Easy-Medium 
difficulty problems due to limited time. Dont waste time on Hard problems. Those who want
you to do a Hard problem in a job interview are not worthy of working for anyway as they 
most likely see thing only from their own point of view.

The below are some resources I used for for coding test training and practice while I was
at it.

- Algoexpert.io - provide video for explaining the algorithms behind every problem.
    You have to purchase access to their coding test problems and training video.
    The site focuses on coding test problems that they said most popular in interview.
    There is a video explaining how a problem is solved for every problem on their site.
    It is a good educational and training source. 

    The cost is $135.00/year which is significantly cheaper than LEETCODE ($35.00/month).

- leetcode.com - One of the most popular sites on coding tests that recommended by all big
    tech companies, e.g. facebook, google, etc.  The site has tons of coding tests listed,
    but it is mainly a site where people comes to hone their programming skillset and get
    familiar with coding tests.

    Most problems listed can be accessed with a free account. However, a paid account will
    allow you gain access to problems often used by big tech companies in their interview.
    The cost of a paid account is $35.00/mo. I recommend you to save your solutions some
    places else before discontinuing your subscription service since you will not be able 
    to access the content of these problems after you end the subscription. I worked on many 
    other problems when I had the subscription, but unable to access them to add to this repo 
    after I ended the subscription.

- geekstogeeks.com - Another good coding test solution resource is this website. You can find 
    solutions to almost any coding test problems on this website. The site also offers plenty 
    of articles on programming subjects that could be helpful in refreshing your skillsets.

- I found this course "50 popular coding interview problems" on udemy.com to be very helpful. 
  I got it for only $9.90 when it was on-sale. Maybe, you should get it for training.
  
... Happy coding!!!
