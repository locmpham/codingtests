  Find peak element

  A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

  Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains 
  multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

  You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

  Example 1:
  Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

  Example 2:
  Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
    or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
